Detailed instructions:

Building path:

The game starts with one black-star tile in the top-left corner, click either to the left or down that tile in order to build another tile of black-star, which is the "path" of the game. After building a path of 50 tiles, press enter to start the first wave. Mobs follow the path. 

Placing towers:

One can buy towers by clicking on them on the right and clicking on any tile that is not a path tile. Keep in mind towers can only be placed after one builds the path of 50 tiles.   

Wave control:

After the last enemy dies, pressing enter starts the next wave. There are 20 waves in total.

Towers:
